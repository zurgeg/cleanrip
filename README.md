# Device Compatibility
Please note that the Wii can be picky about particular USB drives/storage devices. It's recommended to use a Y cable for hard drives that fail to power up from one USB port alone. If USB flash storage doesn't want to work, try a different brand/size. SD cards on GameCube will potentially have similar issues, it's best to have a few different brands/sizes/types at your disposal.
